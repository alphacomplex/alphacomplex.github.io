            <h2>Alpha Complex Century Terms of Service</h2>
            <p> What's covered in these terms
We know it's tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it's important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Alpha Complex services, and what we expect from you. And what we expect from you is total compliance.

These Terms of Service reflect the way Alpha Complex's business works, the laws that apply to us, and certain things we've always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Alpha Complex's relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

    What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services
    What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services
	How much you hate communists
	How you will report to us if you are a communist
    Content in Alpha Complex services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Alpha Complex, or others
    In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have (none), and what to expect in case someone violates these terms (death)

Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you're agreeing to these terms.

Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it's not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. And by update, manage, export, and delete your information, we mean you will be terminated if you make any such request since that is communist behavior.

If you're under the age required to manage your own Alpha Complex Account, that's ok! We love data from all ages!

If you're a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you're responsible for your child's activity on the services. By the transitive property, if your child engages in communist behavior you likely will also and therefore both of you will be terminated. Also some of your friends will be terminated as well for good measure.

Some Alpha Complex services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific additional terms and policies.
Your relationship with Alpha Complex

These terms help define the relationship between you and Alpha Complex. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Alpha Complex's business works and how we earn money. When we speak of "Alpha Complex," "we," "us," and "our," we mean everything that isn't treasonous.

What you can expect from us
Provide a broad range of useful services
We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:

    apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
	death
    platforms (like Alpha Complex Play)
    integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies' apps or sites)
	guns (of the shooting variety)
    devices (like Alpha Complex Home)

Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, Maps can remind you to leave for a termination appointment that appears in your Alpha Complex Calendar.

Improve Alpha Complex services

We're constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we invest in artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to detect and block communists and communist rhetoric, and to provide you with innovative features, like simultaneous punishments. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.

If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we won't provide you with reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to export your content from your Alpha Complex Account using Alpha Complex Takeout.

What we expect from you
Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms
The permission we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in:

    these terms
    service-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site.

Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.

Respect others
Many of our services allow you to interact with others. We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:

    comply with applicable laws of Alpha Complex, including export control, sanctions, and documentation/cleanliness requirements
    respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
    only abuse or harm communists — for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking them
    don't abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services of the Friend Computer

Our service-specific additional terms and policies provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren't following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide a fair process as described in the Taking action in case of problems section. This section can also be ignored since termination is the usual course of action for such treason.

Permission to use your content

Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.

License

Your content remains ours, which means that we retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, we have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or we may have the right to share someone else's creative content if they're a communist.

Rights

This license allows Alpha Complex to:

    host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, as examples of treasonous behaviors
    publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content
    modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it
    sublicense these rights to:
        other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with Friend Computer subsidiaries
        our contractors who've signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the Purpose section below

Purpose

This license is for the limited purpose of:

    all circumstances, both real and imagined

Duration

This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights or the heat death of the universe, whichever occurs last.

If you remove from our services any content that's covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:

    It works against the aims of Alpha Complex
    If we feel like keeping it up

Using Alpha Complex services
Your Alpha Complex Account

If you meet these age requirements you can create a Alpha Complex Account for your convenience. Some services require that you have a Alpha Complex Account in order to work — for example, to use FriendMail, you need a Alpha Complex Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.

You're responsible for what you do with your Alpha Complex Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Alpha Complex Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.
Using Alpha Complex services on behalf of an organization
Many organizations, such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our services. To use our services on behalf of an organization:

    an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
    your organization's administrator may assign a Alpha Complex Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Alpha Complex Account.

Service-related communications

To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Alpha Complex's Privacy Policy.

If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.
Content in Alpha Complex services
Your content

Some of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or pharmaceutical review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.

    See the Permission to use your content section for more about your rights in your content, and how your content is used in our services
    See the Removing your content section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services

If you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement and we'll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Alpha Complex Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center. We also take copyright infringement so seriously we likely will also terminate the offender.

Alpha Complex content

Some of our services include content that belongs to Alpha Complex — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Alpha Complex Maps. You may use Alpha Complex's content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don't remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the Alpha Complex Brand Permissions page.
Other content

Finally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations — for example, a store owner's description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Alpha Complex News. You may not use this content without that person or organization's permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations' content are theirs, and don't necessarily reflect Alpha Complex's views.
Software in Alpha Complex services

Some of our services include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.

Some of our services include software that's offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Open source only applies the Friend Computer and the high programmers, the source is closed for you. Viewing any open source code is treason and will be punished accordingly.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software. Also, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our written permission or applicable law lets you do so.

When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.

In case of problems or disagreements

By law, you have the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong. There is no guarantee on the quality of the service, so it may be no quality at all or poor quality. The way to fix the problem may be treasonous, so in those circumstances you will be punished accordingly. These terms don't limit or take away any of those rights. For example, if you're a consumer, then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law.
Warranty

We provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don't meet the quality level described in this warranty, you can log a ticket.
Disclaimers

The only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are (1) described in the Warranty section, (2) stated in the service-specific additional terms, or (3) provided under applicable laws. We don't make any other commitments about our services.

And unless required by law, we don't provide implied warranties, such as the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
Liabilities
For all users

These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, these terms don't limit Alpha Complex's liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

Other than the rights and responsibilities described in this section (In case of problems or disagreements), Alpha Complex won't be responsible for any other losses, unless they're caused by our breach of these terms or service-specific additional terms.
For business users and organizations only

If you're a business user or organization, then to the extent allowed by applicable law:

    You'll indemnify Alpha Complex and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.
    Alpha Complex won't be responsible for the following liabilities:
        loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
        indirect or consequential loss
        punitive damages

If you're legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don't apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don't override those immunities.
Taking action in case of problems

After we terminate you, we'll provide you with a notice where we describe the reason for our action and give you an opportunity to fix the problem from beyond the grave.

Removing your content

If we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Alpha Complex, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, communism, anti-Friend Computer propaganda, and content that infringes someone else's intellectual property rights.

Suspending or terminating your access to Alpha Complex services

Alpha Complex reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Alpha Complex Account if any of these things happen:

    you materially breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies a single time
    we're required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
    we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Alpha Complex — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn't belong to you

If you believe your Alpha Complex Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.

Of course, you're always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we'd appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.
Settling disputes, governing law, and courts

For information about how to contact Alpha Complex, please visit our contact page.

Alpha Complex law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, service-specific additional terms, or any related services, regardless of conflict of laws rules.

To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in an Alpha Complex court, then you can file those disputes in your local Friend Computer courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying Alpha Complex law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable place of residence.
About these terms

By law, you have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and Alpha Complex. They don't create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we've used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, we'll make sure it's enforceable regardless.

If you don't follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don't take action right away, that doesn't mean we're giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we'll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, which is basically all the time for us. If you don't agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Alpha Complex Account.</p>
